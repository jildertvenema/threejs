RcGen9=Got it!
RcGen10=Get it!
RcGen11=So, one less!
RcGen17=Oh, I see!
RcGen18=Oh, I see!
RcGen20=Look at this!
RcGen21=What do we have here?
RcGen25=I can use that!
RcGen26=Thank you!
RcGen27=Fleuriefee!!!
RcGen28=Fleuriefee!!!
RcGen29=Fleuriefee!!!
RcGen30=Fleuriefee
RcGen31=Fleuriefee???
RcGen33=pom pom pom
RcGen35=Well done!
RcGen36=Keep it up!
RcGen37=Excellent!
RcGen38=Fantastic!
RcGen39=Not bad, but it could be better.
RcGen42=Yi-mauw! A magical mirror
RcGen43=Yi-mauww! Another magical mirror!

RcGen44=Where am I?
RcGen45=Let me take a look around!
RcGen46=What's that over there!
RcGen47=Let me see...
RcGen48=Were you the one who scared me like that?
RcGen49=Who are you?
RcGen50=Why are you crying? Did I hurt you?
RcGen51=Why did she do that?
RcGen52=Oh, so Grizella hasn't succeeded yet?
RcGen53=What??? A beautiful pink cat! That must be WhizzKitty. I have to save her as soon as possible.
RcGen54=Collaborate! Meow! Great idea!
RcGen55=And I'll write down all the important information you give me in my CatMemo. I can always access it via the F2 key.
RcGen56=Now, I'll head to the castle! See you soon, Fleuriefee!
RcGen57=And if I accidentally fall in?
RcGen58=Meow! That's handy! And the coins?
RcGen59=Wow, I have to grab everything quickly! But how?
RcGen60=Meow, super!
RcGen61=Do all the doors work with a button?
RcGen62=Yes, of course! Press the SHOOT button.
RcGen63=That's really dangerous!
RcGen64=Okay!
RcGen65=I'll write it down in my CatMemo right away!
RcGen66=And now... I have to find WhizzKitty. On to the castle!
RcGen67=It's quite dark here!
RcGen68=Me? No way!
RcGen69=Okay!
RcGen70=That's where we need to go!
RcGen71=How do we get there?
RcGen72=I'll do it!
RcGen73=What's that now?
RcGen74=Wow! Turbo!
RcGen75=Hooray, I've defeated him!
RcGen76=Oh no! It's really scary here!
RcGen77=What was she doing there?
RcGen78=Me? Uh, no!
RcGen79=I don't see anything special!
RcGen80=Great! Uh... how does it work?
RcGen81=Yes, thankfully.
RcGen82=But where do I go now, Fleuriefee? I don't see any doors.
RcGen83=I'm here!
RcGen84=Yes, where are we?
RcGen85=What?
RcGen86=Oh, so we're getting closer to the witch.
RcGen87=Nobody at all?
RcGen88=Look, there are little drawings on all corners of the figure.
RcGen89=What's that?
RcGen90=Bengbeng!
RcGen91=Of course! I dare anything!
RcGen92=Why?
RcGen93=Well, what a shame!
RcGen94=Yes? So?
RcGen95=Well, okay. Bye Fleuriefee!
RcGen95a=Hopefully I'll see you later as a princess.
RcGen96=WhizzKitty! There you are!
RcGen97=Of course! I wasn't scared at all.
RcGen98=Fortunately, Fleuriefee helped me. Here she comes now!
RcGen99=Ohhhh!
RcGen100=She's turned back into a princess! She looks beautiful!
RcGen101=Well, I feel like a Catshake!
RcGen102=I'd like to try one of those magic shakes! You don't have them on CatPlanet! With stars and all...
RCext1=He seems enchanted!
RCext2=Brutus seems enchanted.
RCext3=Did the witch enchant him?
RCext4=Max is also enchanted!
RCext5=My superbengs don't seem to work!!
RCext6=Huh! Where did he go?
RCext7=So! Back to the magic realm!

WKGen1=RedCat!!!!
WKGen2=Reeeeedcaaaaat!
WKGen3=RedCat help me!
WKGen4=Hurry up RedCat!
WKGen5=Quick, RedCat!
WKGen6=RedCat, it's almost twelve o'clock!
WKGen7=RedCat, watch out for the witch!
WKGen8=RedCat, watch out!
WKGen9=Help, RedCat, help!
WKGen10=RedCat! Help! Get me out of here!
WKGen11=RedCat! I knew you would come! But you shouldn't stand there! The witch could come back any moment! Place the mirrors in the holders on the wall. That's the only chance to defeat the witch! Hurry!
WKGen12=Hooray! The witch is defeated! We did it!
WKGen13=Ohhhh!
WKGen14=We can also drink those at home, you know!




;// Fleuriefee

FLGen1=RedCat!!
FLGen2=RedCat??
FLGen3=Snik, snik
FLGen4=Yes, that was me.
FLGen5=My name is Fleuriefee.
FLGen6=No, I'm not hurt. I'm just sad. You know, I used to be a beautiful little princess. I lived happily in my castle until the ugly witch Grizella put a spell on me.
FLGen7=The witch was jealous. She wanted everything I had. By casting a spell on me, she could move into my castle. But she was still ugly. That's why she had to make a beauty potion. But no matter how hard she tried, nothing could make her beautiful!
FLGen8=No! But she thinks it WILL work tonight! At the stroke of midnight, she will add the beauty of a beautiful, pink cat to the beauty potion!
FLGen9=Wait! If you go alone, you'll get lost for sure! I know the way around here. Unfortunately, I can't go too far from my magic lantern. You'll get my help as soon as you get close to a magic lantern. That way, we can work together to rescue WhizzKitty and defeat Grizella.
FLGen10=Watch out, RedCat! There's a log in the road. You'll have to jump over it. Press the JUMP button while moving forward.
FLGen11=Do you see that thing, RedCat? That's a magical Save Pillar! You can activate a Save Pillar by walking over it. Then, if you fall off, you'll start again at that point. You don't have to start all over again! Handy, right?
FLGen12=Whoa! You can't just walk past here. You'll have to jump over this. Press the JUMP button while moving forward.
FLGen13=But be careful not to fall in. Because in shallow water, a cat like you will take damage! You'll recognize shallow water by its light blue color.
FLGen14=Then you can replenish your health with a heart. Pick up the heart by walking over it.
FLGen15=Oh, do you see that? All those bottles and coins! Those bottles contain magic potion. If you collect enough of them for me, I can restore my magic power. And then I can give you a special power that can help you further.
FLGen16=The coins are made of real gold! The more you collect, the more points you get.
FLGen17=You can pick up the magic bottles and coins by walking over them.
FLGen18=Good job! You've collected enough magic potion bottles! I can now give you magical shooting power.
FLGen19=Do you see that pink box? You can shoot it to pieces. Sometimes there's something nice inside! Press the SHOOT button to fire magical Bengbeng balls.
FLGen20=Too bad, RedCat! You need shooting power here. But I don't have enough magic power to give it to you yet! I need more magic potion bottles for that. Would you like to collect more bottles first? See you soon!
FLGen21=There's a button behind that box! You can press it by going to it and touching it! Then a door will open.
FLGen22=No, most of the doors you encounter will open automatically when you walk up to them.
FLGen23=Be careful of RedCat, that looks dangerous! You can avoid the enemy by stepping aside. You must press the AVOID button while moving to the right or left. But of course, you can also attack it. Do you remember how to shoot?
FLGen24=Watch out! This lake is too deep for a cat. You can see that from the dark blue color. If you fall in there, you're done.
FLGen25=You can see a button on the other side, so you can't reach it. But you can press it by shooting at it! Try it!
FLGen26=Where is Brutus? He's gone! Well done, RedCat!
FLGen27=Did you hear what Brutus said? Those were probably important hints!
FLGen28=Look, what Brutus left there! Such a mirror he was talking about! Grab it quickly!
FLGen29=That wasn't like that before! You're not afraid, are you, RedCat?
FLGen30=Fortunately, because you have to go inside! You can lower the drawbridge by shooting at the button. If you can find 20 bottles of magic potion, I can give you a new magic power again later.
FLGen31=Did you hear that? WhizzKitty is in the tower!
FLGen32=But the old entrance to the tower is gone!
FLGen33=I don't know. The staircase to the throne room was just magically removed too! There must be something important there! First, try to find the throne room.
FLGen34=What a mess Grizella made here! You'll have to push some things aside before you can get through. You can move the green boxes by pressing a button.
FLGen35=Well done! You have collected enough bottles of magic potion. Now I can give you a TurboBeng.
FLGen36=This will give your magic balls extra shooting power. Here it comes!
FLGen37=Too bad, RedCat. You need more shooting power here. But I need more bottles of magic potion to give you that shooting power. Will you go get some more bottles? See you later!
FLGen38=Well done! Grab the mirror he left behind!
FLGen39=Did you hear what Max said about the chapel? I know where it is! It's in the cemetery. Come on, we have to go there!
FLGen40=It wasn't always like this! It used to be beautiful and sunny here. I know Grizella used to come here too.
FLGen41=I don't know. But Max didn't mention the chapel for nothing! The answers must be found in the cemetery, RedCat!
FLGen42=And if you find 30 bottles of magic potion for me, I can give you a special power again.
FLGen43=Come on, RedCat, you're not afraid, are you?
FLGen44=Look! This blue box can explode if you shoot at it. This way, you can make holes in walls and defeat scary enemies, for example.
FLGen45=Oh, that looks like a magic gate. If you stand in it, you'll be magically transported to another place. Try it!
FLGen46=Yes, it seems so. But I think there's a secret passage in the chapel somewhere! But where? You might find the solution in the mazes surrounding it.
FLGen47=Well done! You've collected so many bottles of magic potion that I can give you a SuperSkipper. With this, you can jump very high.
FLGen48=First you jump up into the air. While you're in the air, press the JUMP button again. You'll jump super high!
FLGen49=Watch out, RedCat! You need a SuperSkip here. I can't give you this power yet, because you haven't collected enough magic bottles. You need to collect more bottles first. See you later!
FLGen50=Yay! You've defeated it nicely! Look, there's another one of those mirrors! You can get something from it.
FLGen51=RedCat! Where are you?
FLGen52=Are you okay?
FLGen53=It seems like some kind of cave! Oh, of course!
FLGen54=This must be the secret cave where the witch used to live! I never believed that story! But it's true after all!
FLGen55=Yes, you're on the right track! And if you find 30 magic bottles here, I can give you another special power.
FLGen56=Oh yes, I know what this is! This is a magic witch altar. It creates magic bars that no one can pass through.
FLGen57=Well... Maybe there's a way to turn them off. But I don't know how. You have to figure it out!
FLGen58=Yes, and there are also drawings on the doors. They are symbols for water, fire, air, and earth! That must have a special meaning! Good luck solving it, RedCat!
FLGen59=See that red box? That's a kind of trampoline. If you jump on it, you'll go very high or very far! Very handy for a little cat. Try it!
FLGen60=Great! You've collected so many magic bottles that I can give you a BigBeng.
FLGen61=With this, you can charge up the magic Bengbeng balls, so you can fire them with mega power. Here it comes!
FLGen62=Bengbeng!
FLGen63=Watch out! Keep the SHOOT button pressed until the BigBeng is charged. Then release the SHOOT button to shoot with mega power.
FLGen64=Listen, RedCat! You need a new special power soon. I can't give you this power yet, because you haven't collected enough magic bottles. Collect some more bottles first. See you later!
FLGen65=Hooray, we made it! Oh no, there's another mirror. Grab it quickly! The way is open to the tower! If you dare, that is!
FLGen66=Shh, ...
FLGen67=Did you hear that? WhizzKitty and Grizella are up there in the tower! We have to say goodbye here. I can't help you from here anymore.
FLGen68=The evil influence of the witch is too strong here. You have to do this alone now, RedCat!
FLGen69=Do you remember what Max said? Grizella can't stand her own reflection.
FLGen70=You've collected all those mirrors, right? You'll probably have to do something with them later! Good luck, RedCat! And be careful!
FLGen71=You've freed me, RedCat. The spell is broken. How can I ever thank you?
FLGen72=Oh no, there's another one of those mirrors. Grab it quickly!




;// Max
MXIIlv1=Ha, there we have a red cat, eh I mean, RedCat hihihi. You think again that you have to play the hero! Well, you'll never find WhizzKitty! You silly cat! If you want to reach the chapel, you must first get past me. And of course, you'll never be able to do that, hihihihi!

MXIVlv1=Halt! No one passes the tower guard! The witch doesn't want you in the tower! The witch can't even stand her own reflection. Let alone a bunch of losers! Get lost!

;// Brutus

BRintro1=Hey, Max! She's warning that red cat!
BRintro2=Uh-uh... How do you turn off this stupid thing?
Brlvl1=Dumdumdumdum
Brlvl2=Oah!
Brlvl3=So, you've come after all, red cat! Don't think you can save WhizzKitty. She's safe in the castle!
Brlvl4=And those 5 mirrors, you'll never get them either!
Brlvl5=Owh!
Brlvl6=Well, you're not going to get past my mushroom launcher!
Briilvl1=Dumdumdumdum!
Briilvl2=Who??? Who's disturbing me now?
Briilvl3=Oh, it's that miserable cat again!
Briilvl4=Go away! Leave me and my bones alone! There's nothing here for you! Get lost, I told you!

;// Misc

GRGen1=Hahaha... HAHAHAHAHAHA!
Grizel1=Keep your mouth shut, you misfit!
Grizel2=What are you doing here, nasty red cat! Are you trying to save that little kitten? Are you going to mess everything up? That won't happen! Stay away from those mirrors! Oh, I hate mirrors! Shoo, shoo! Go away!
Grizel3=Huh!
Grizel4=The clock is striking. It's almost 12 o'clock. I have to go to my cauldron now. Get out of my way, cat! This can't fail!
Grizel5=Argh, that light! You miserable cat! You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back! Do you hear me, RedCat? I'll be back!
Grizel6=You'll never make it!
Grizel7=You're too late!
Grizel8=Get out of my castle!
Grizel9=You can't do it, RedCat!
Grizel10=Wretched cat!
Grizel11=At 12 o'clock, WhizzKitty goes into the soup!
Grizel12=You fluffy, fidgety flea pile!
Grizel13=Now I'm sure I'll become a beautiful woman! Nothing can stop me!
Grizel14=Lalalala! This potion makes me prettier. With this potion, I'll surely become a beautiful woman...Lalalala...
Grizel15=Lalala...Nice little brew! Lalala... Nice little brew! Lalala...
